5)
Each thread handles 5 loops, or the number of total iterations divided by maximum threads

6)
If some iterations run significantly longer than others, then that one thread will slow the entire process down.

7)
It will assign the first thread the first 5 loops, causing the entire process to take 5 seconds.
It took about 5 seconds, with thread 0 finishing well after the other threads.

8)
It finished in about 1 seconds

9)
One thread processed most of the remaining loops by itself. First trial was thread 2, second was thread 4.

10)
Something like the number of iterations or processor time one thread can be assigned before assigning to the next thread.
