syntax for inbitstream
	bitstream in = new inbitstream()?

InBitSteam inputfile;
inputfile.open("banana.myzip");

int b = inputfile.read();

same general questions about the functions?
	will it just be in.open()?



Continue running until an input ends or automatically close after each file?
Prompt with text or expect the filename automatically?

//read in to build tree

//then decode:
while (!inputfile.eof())
{
//decode one letter
}



Note for pseudocode: It'll be an outfile, not cout. So adjust the decode portion to:

	if(i = 1){
		int value = (int)it*;
		out.write(value, 8);
}

BinaryTree<char> tree;

cout << *position; //where position is an iterator
