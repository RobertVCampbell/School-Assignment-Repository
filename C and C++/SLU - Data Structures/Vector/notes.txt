Questions:
	for sort, do I have to pass the array or can it just access _data
	does c++ truncate or round division remainders


Find maximum of an array
	has to linear search, because vector isn't guaranteed to be sorted

again, sorted

Sort:
	let's do quick sort
		split between sort(), sort(things), swap(indexes)
	

reverse:
	sort
	linearly replace
	


vector of type Object
	contains:
		int _capacity
		int _size
		Object* _data  (array)

existing functions:
	insert(int, object)
	int size()
	bool empty()
	erase(int index)
	pushback(Object)
	pop_back()
	push_front(object)
	pop_front()
	int capacity()		
	Object maximum()

operators:
	[]
	==
	=
