Homework Assignment #4: SmartStack
Student: Robert Campbell
Submitted: 23FEB2019

   The submitted version runs through the test data without issue.
   
   Run time should only be increased by a coefficient for most functions, with
the extra steps of incrementing or decrementing being added in.

   The biggest difference in run time would be seen in the copy functions, entirely
because the Stack now uses shallow instead of deep copies.

   With the number of repeated increment and decrement lines, it might be easier
 to have defined a separate function. I attempted that at first, but ran into some
 smaller decision making issues. With the extra logic that I was thinking would be
 needed, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra space of new functions versus
 the few repeated lines.
