```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
# This line makes your figures smaller (you want to do this!)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=5, fig.height=3)

# This code loads the dplyr library
# You often want to load libraries at the start of your file
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
```

This is an R Markdown document.  You can turn it into HTML with the Knit menu in RStudio.
If you are willing to install LaTeX, you can produce a PDF document directly.

## First Section

Want some text? Just type it.

Want a list?

* One thing
* Another thing
* The end

This is **important**, this is not.

LaTeX math formatting is built in, use `$` to start and end math.

Is your favorite function $x^2$?  Mine is $\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$.

Using `\[` and `\]` puts math on its own line:
\[ \sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{1+x^2} \]

## Second Section

You can include R code which will display, run, and display its output.
Type CTRL-Option-I to insert an R code block.

Here's some R code using the built-in `iris` data set.

```{r}
str(iris)
max(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

Here's a plot:

```{r}
iris %>% filter(Species == 'setosa') %>%
  select(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width) %>% plot()
```
