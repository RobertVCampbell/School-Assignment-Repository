The constructor test fails each size test, since the stubbed out constructor does not actually calculate the puzzle size yet.
The invalid move tests both failed, since the stubbed out move() methood only returns true, and does not have any logic.
Testing if a puzzle was solved failed, because the stubbed method isSolved() only returns false.
